## Assignment 

Final peer-graded assignment for the Coursera course 'Reproducible Templates for Analysis and Dissemination'


For your final assignment, you need to create a document or presentation using R Markdown, with the elements listed below, and publish your work to RPubs.

1. Create an HTML document or HTML presentation slide with these 8 items:

    - A Title

    - Your Name as Author

    - The Date

    - A section of text summarizing the information in your document or slide presentation (keep this between 3-4 sentences)

    - A bulleted list of 3 or more items (either numbered or unnumbered)

    - A plot of the built-in 'pressure' dataset

    - A table of the top 6 rows of the built-in 'cars' dataset

    - Apply a theme or style that changes the font, colors, or other formatting instead of the default template. (HINT: Remember to explore the options in the prettydoc, rmdformats, or revealjs packages)

2. Knit the document or presentation to HTML

3. Publish the document or presentation to RPubs

When you complete this assignment, submit the URL of your RPubs published document or presentation below.

#### *Note:* the HTML is published on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/opresanis/reproducible)
